#| A: A non-empty list|#

#| Q: What is the cons of the atom a and the list l where a is peanut and l is (butter and jelly) 
      This can also be written "(cons a l)". Read: "cons the atom a onto the list l." |#
#| A: (cons peanut (butter and jelly)) is (peanut butter and jelly), b/c cons adds the expression
      as the first element to the beginning of a list |#
(cons 'peanut '(butter and jelly)) ; ==> '(peanut butter and jelly)

#| Q: What is the cons of s and l where s is (banana and) and l is (peanut butter and jelly) |#
#| A: (cons (banana and) (peanut butter and jelly) is ((banana and) peanut butter and jelly) |#

      beginning of the list |#
(cons '((help) this) '(is very ((hard) to learn))) ;==> '(((help) this) is very ((hard) to learn))

#| Q: What does cons take as its arguments? |#
#| A: It takes two arguments: an expression and a list |#

#| A: (a) |#
(cons 'a '()) ; ==> '(a)

#| Q: What is (cons s l) where s is ((a b c)) and l is b |#

(list? (cons '((a b c)) 'b)) ; ==> #f



#|           *** The Law of Cons *** 
      The primitive cons takes two arguments. 
       The second argument to cons must be a 
           list. The result is a list. |#
